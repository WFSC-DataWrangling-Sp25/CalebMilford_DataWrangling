#May the 4th be with you 

#Guidelines; 
  #10 weeks of total material: following are required (label each one)
    #Week 5: Data visualization (ggplot) (there are literally a million things)
    #Week 8: Basically just writing out instrictions of what youre doing in the code.
    #Beginning description and discriptions between each code chunk 
    #Week 9: Just need to put it in an R studio project aka donezo 
    #Week 10: Needs to be in a "Final Project Github repo. Think this is done? Double check 
    #Week 11: Functions: Write my own (something to do with site level covariates, maybe like total vegetation cover)
    #Week 12: Making Choices: if/else statements (Can you filter target species like this?)
    #Week 13: Iterations (loopy loops) (not sure, should ask Ellen)
  
  #Javan suggested tasks and how to apply them to weeks 
    #General data clean up (Week 6?) DO THIS FIRST
    #Looking at net surveys (Week 3?) 
    #One row per survey with only my target species(Week 6?) DO THIS SECOND
    #summarize detections by month/year (week 4?) Might need to ask Javan for clarification on this 
    #summarize # of sites surveyed per year (simple data frame) (week 3?) PROBABLY CAN DO THIS THIRD


#Actual first things that need to be done are confirming that weeks 8,9,10 are 
#completed and set up properly. Once that is complete, then you can more on to "DO THIS FIRST"
