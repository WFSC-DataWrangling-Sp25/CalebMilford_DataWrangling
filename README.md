# Occupancy modeling of the Sonoran desert toad and mud turtle

##### CalebMilford_DataWrangling

## Summary

This repository includes data sets and code looking at the encounter history of Sonoran desert toad and Sonoran mud turtles over the course of 3 years. These are presence/ absence studies that also record different landscape and site covariate data. The code is designed to help determine what are detection level covariates for these two species.

## Structure

-   data_raw - starting data

    -   The data I am using primarily is in the "Combined_Frog" CSV file

-   data_clean - data that has been restructures and/or cleaned

-   scripts - different code chunks

    -   Planning doc - just for me to help think about all the objectives I need to accomplish both between this class and what would be useful for my thesis.

-   output - plots and graphs
