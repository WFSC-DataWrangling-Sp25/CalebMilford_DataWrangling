# Occupancy modeling of the Sonoran desert toad and mud turtle

##### CalebMilford_DataWrangling

## Summary

This repository includes data sets and code looking at the encounter history of Sonoran desert toad and Sonoran mud turtles over the course of 3 years. These are presence/ absence studies that also record different landscape and site covariate data. The code is designed to help determine what are detection level covariates for these two species.

## Structure

-   data_raw - starting data

    -   The data I am using primarily is in the "Combined_Frog" CSV file
    -   The RMD files may be used in the future but not at the moment so they can be ignored
    -   The RABE_SiteQuery_HerpsDB.csv is a completely seperate part of my thesis but I am using this opportunity to practice doing some geospacial data manipulation with it

-   data_clean - data that has been restructures and/or cleaned

    -   The two clean tables are summaries for each of my occupancy model species showing the number of times the were detected per month throughout the year

-   scripts - different code chunks

    -   Planning doc - just for me to help think about all the objectives I need to accomplish both between this class and what would be useful for my thesis. This mostly can be ignore unless you want to see how my weird brain works

-   output - plots, graphs and tables
